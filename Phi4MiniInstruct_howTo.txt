To get "microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct" to work:

###########
Check "nvidia-smi" at cmd prompt for output to make sure your system is AI-enabled.
For HuggingFace transformers you will need to:
pip install transformers
pip install datasets
pip install accelerate

You need at least 8GB to run as a CUDA device. Otherwise, set the sample to "cpu."
There are quantized versions of the model that might fit in 6GB or 4GB GPUs but they may be less accurate; I don't have samples for these right now.
